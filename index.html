      Future orientation means creating a roadmap for your future, understanding
      how todayâ€™s actions impact those goals, and frequently checking progress
      toward the goals. Being future-oriented motivates you to achieve goals and
      helps you make better decisions.

      The process of creating a roadmap for your future starts with highlighting

    </ul>
